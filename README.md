# COSC345---ReciPlease
COSC 345 - Software engineering, app creation project.

Generate and choose from recipes based on your budget and number of people you are cooking for.

**How to run the application:**

We developed ReciPlease on the iPhone 11 pro max, but our app works on any iPhone

Using Xcode, start the iPhone simulator, ideally using the iPhone 11 pro max, and enter a budget and the number of people you will be cooking for. To generate recipes, click on the 'What am I cooking' button which will lead you to three recipes to click and choose from. The app scrapes the Countdown database and generates the pricing from thi scrape.

Currently there are no actual recipes loaded into the app as we have no persistant memory, but this will be changed in the beta release. We will also be adding more products and a mechanism to add your own recipes to the app through a product search.
